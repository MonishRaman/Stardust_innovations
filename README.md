# Solar System Model üåçüåûü™ê

This project is a simple 2D simulation of the solar system, showcasing planets orbiting around the Sun in a circular pattern. The model is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a basic visualization of planetary motion, including Earth's Moon.

## Demo
Check out the live demo of the project:
[Live Demo]((https://stardustinnovations.netlify.app/)) 

## Features
- **Sun**: The center of the solar system, around which all planets orbit.
- **Planets**: Simulated orbits for:
  - Mercury, Venus, Earth (with Moon), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (with Rings), Uranus, and Neptune.
- **Earth's Moon**: Orbits around the Earth.
- **Planetary Rotation**: Each planet revolves around the Sun at different speeds, proportional to its distance from the Sun.
- **Scalable Orbits**: The orbits and rotations are based on simplified but scalable measurements for educational purposes.

## Technologies
- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Visuals, including animations for rotation and orbit paths.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic of orbital paths and planet motions.

## Installation
